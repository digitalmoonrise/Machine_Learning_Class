Lecture Notes Week One

Data->Regression->Intelligence

This course is going to use the housing price dataset

Simple Regression: 1 input to just fit a line. 
    1.Goodness of fit metric: Gradient Descent algorithm (lower is better fit)

Multiple regression
    2. More complex than just a line, and incorporates more than one input

Bias-variance tradeoff: simple models behave well, but are too simple whereas complicated models describe well what is happening to data, but behave strangely when it comes to the data. 

Regression Fundamentals

Simple Regression

Data = (X1 = sq.ft, y1 = $)...(Xi = sqft, Yi = $)

Input = X
Output = Y

IDea is that we can predict $ based on SQFT or a function f(x).

Regression model = Yi = f(Xi) + Ei

E(epsolon) = error

E[Ei] = 0
Equally likely that our error is positive or negative. This implies that Yi could be >|< f(Xi)

simple linear f(x)

Yi = W0 + W1Xi + Ei

W0 = intercept
W1 = Slope 
xi = input 


REsidual sum of squares (RSS) -- Adding up the residuals from the actual observation and the line

      N    
Sigma Σ ai,  What this means is that you're summing over a ai until N)
     i=1  
             N
RSS(W0,W1) = Σ (Y1-[w0+w1xi])^2
            i=1
